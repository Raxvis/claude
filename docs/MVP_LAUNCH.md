  PURPOSE: Launch readiness audit template. Use this document to assess whether the project
           is ready for release by cataloguing bugs, verifying requirements alignment,
           and tracking launch blockers.

  HOW TO CUSTOMIZE:
  - Replace [PROJECT_NAME] with your project name.
  - Replace [VERSION] with the target release version (e.g., "1.0.0").
  - Replace [AUDIT_DATE] with the date this audit was conducted.
  - Fill in the Overall Verdict table with the current status for each area.
  - Add entries to bug/issue tables as they are discovered.
  - Update the Requirements Alignment table from your PRD or requirements document.
  - Work through the Launch Checklist and mark items Complete / In Progress / Not Started.
  - Status values used throughout: Complete, In Progress, Not Started, Blocked, N/A.
