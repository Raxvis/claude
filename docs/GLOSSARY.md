<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS
  FILE: GLOSSARY.md
  PURPOSE: Provides canonical, unambiguous definitions for every domain-specific term
  used across the project's documents and codebase. When any document uses a term that
  might be misunderstood or that has a project-specific meaning, that term belongs here.
  This document is the single source of truth for terminology. If two documents use the
  same word differently, the definition here wins and the documents must be updated.

  HOW TO CUSTOMIZE:
  - Replace all [TERM_NAME] and [PLACEHOLDER] tokens with real terms and definitions.
  - Organize terms into the categories below, adding new categories if needed.
  - Write definitions in the present tense, as facts: "[TERM] is..." not "[TERM] will be..."
  - Cross-reference related terms using "See also: [OTHER_TERM]".
  - If a term is used in the codebase with a specific identifier (e.g. an interface name
    or a store field name), note the code identifier alongside the human-readable definition.
  - Keep definitions concise — one to three sentences. Detail belongs in ADDITIONAL.md.
  - Remove placeholder entries that you have not yet replaced; do not leave unfilled
    [TERM_NAME] entries in the final document.
