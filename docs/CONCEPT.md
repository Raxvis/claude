<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS
  FILE: CONCEPT.md
  PURPOSE: Captures the founding vision for the project in plain language. This document
  answers "what is this and why does it exist?" before any technical or feature detail is
  introduced. It should be readable by a non-technical stakeholder and should remain stable
  across development — it is a north-star reference, not a task list.

  HOW TO CUSTOMIZE:
  - Use the Concept Template below to add new concept entries.
  - Delete the template example once you have real entries.
  - Keep the language high-level. If you find yourself writing acceptance criteria or
    implementation details, those belong in PRD.md or ADDITIONAL.md.
  - Revisit this document at the start of each milestone to confirm the vision is still
    accurate. If it has drifted, update it rather than leaving it stale.
