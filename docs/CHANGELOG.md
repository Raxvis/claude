<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS
  FILE: CHANGELOG.md
  PURPOSE: Chronological log of notable changes across releases and milestones. Tracks what
           was added, changed, removed, or fixed in each version of the project.

  HOW TO CUSTOMIZE:
  - Replace [PROJECT_NAME] with your project name.
  - Add entries in reverse-chronological order (newest at the top).
  - Use the format: `[YYYY-MM-DD] - Title` with sub-bullets for Added/Changed/Removed/Fixed.
  - Keep the Upcoming Documentation Work section updated with planned documentation tasks.
  - Prioritize upcoming work as: High (needed now), Medium (needed soon), Low (nice to have).

## Versioning Strategy

This project uses [VERSIONING_SCHEME] (e.g., Semantic Versioning, Calendar Versioning).

- **Major** version: [Describe when the major version increments, e.g., "Breaking changes to public API or data format."]
- **Minor** version: [Describe when the minor version increments, e.g., "New features that are backward-compatible."]
- **Patch** version: [Describe when the patch version increments, e.g., "Bug fixes and minor improvements."]

The release agent is responsible for determining version numbers based on these rules.

_Last updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]_
