<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS
  File: CHANGELOG.md
  Purpose: Documentation change history for the project. Tracks what was added, changed,
           removed, or fixed in project documentation (not necessarily the codebase itself).

  How to customize:
  - Replace [PROJECT_NAME] with your project name.
  - Add entries in reverse-chronological order (newest at the top).
  - Use the format: `[YYYY-MM-DD] - Title` with sub-bullets for Added/Changed/Removed/Fixed.
  - Keep the Upcoming Documentation Work section updated with planned documentation tasks.
  - Prioritize upcoming work as: High (needed now), Medium (needed soon), Low (nice to have).
