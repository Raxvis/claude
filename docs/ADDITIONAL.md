<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS
  FILE: ADDITIONAL.md
  PURPOSE: This document contains extended design detail that is true to the project's
  vision but too granular or voluminous to live comfortably in PRD.md. It covers advanced
  systems, the nuances of individual mechanics, detailed pacing targets, monetization
  specifics, and post-launch plans. The PRD says "what must be true"; this document says
  "here is exactly how it works in detail".

  HOW TO CUSTOMIZE:
  - Use the Additional Item Template below to add new entries.
  - Delete the template example once you have real entries.
  - If a section grows very large, consider splitting it into its own file and linking to
    it from here.
  - This document should be kept in sync with PRD.md. If a design decision changes,
    update both files.
