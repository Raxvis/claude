<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS
  File: STANDUP.md
  Purpose: Daily (or per-session) development log. Tracks what was completed last session,
           what is planned for the current session, active blockers, and which agents or
           team members are working on the project.

  How to customize:
  - Replace [PROJECT_NAME] with your project name.
  - Add a new entry at the TOP of the Log section for each session (newest first).
  - Fill in all four fields for every session — "None" is a valid value for Blockers.
  - "Active agents" can list AI assistants, team members, or automated tools active that session.
  - Use this log to maintain continuity between sessions and as a lightweight audit trail.
