<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS
  FILE: PRD.md
  PURPOSE: The Product Requirements Document is the authoritative source for what the
  product must do. It bridges the vision in CONCEPT.md with the implementation work
  in code. Every feature must be traceable back to a user story and acceptance criterion
  in this document. Engineers, designers, and QA all refer to the PRD to determine
  whether a feature is "done".

  HOW TO CUSTOMIZE:
  - Replace every [PLACEHOLDER] token with real project content.
  - User Stories follow the format: "As a [USER_TYPE], I want to [ACTION] so that [BENEFIT]."
  - Acceptance Criteria are written as binary pass/fail statements (present tense).
  - Keep the Success Metrics section honest — define what "success" means before you ship,
    not after.
  - The Timeline section uses milestone names, not calendar dates. Add dates only in a
    separate project management tool, not here.
  - The Appendix should contain reference data (tables, formulae) that would disrupt
    reading flow if placed inline.

is explicitly deferred to post-launch.]

---

## Problem Statement

**User problem:** [Describe the real-world need or frustration this product addresses.
Avoid describing the solution here — focus on the problem.]

**Opportunity:** [Why is now the right time to build this? What market gap or user
behavior makes this product viable?]

**Hypothesis:** If we build [SOLUTION_DESCRIPTION], then [USER_TYPE] will [MEASURABLE_BEHAVIOR],
which will result in [BUSINESS_OUTCOME].

  of at least [RATE] on [MINIMUM_SPEC_DEVICE]."]
- [PERFORMANCE_REQUIREMENT_2, e.g. "Cold start time must not exceed [TIME] seconds."]

## Technical Constraints

### [FRAMEWORK] and Architecture

### Persistence

- User data is persisted via [PERSISTENCE_LAYER].
- The save format must include a version field and support forward migration.
- The application must handle missing, empty, or corrupt save data without crashing.

### Dependencies

- New dependencies must be evaluated for [FRAMEWORK] compatibility before adoption.
- Dependencies must be managed via the project's package manager. See `README.md` for
  the correct installation command.

### Build

- The project must build successfully for [PLATFORM_LIST] without modification.
- The build process is documented in the root `README.md`.
