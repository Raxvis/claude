<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS
  File: ASSETS.md
  Purpose: Central inventory of all assets required by the project. Tracks what is needed,
           what exists, what is a placeholder, and what still needs to be created.

  How to customize:
  - Replace [PROJECT_NAME] with your project name.
  - Replace [ASSET_CATEGORY] with your asset categories (e.g., "Character Sprites", "UI Icons").
  - Replace [ASSET_NAME], [FORMAT], [SIZE], [NOTES] with specifics for each asset.
  - Replace [PLATFORM] with the platforms your project targets.
  - Update the Summary table as assets are completed.
  - Mark the "Exists" column with: Yes / No / Placeholder.
  - Add rows to any section as needed; add entirely new sections if your project has unique asset types.
